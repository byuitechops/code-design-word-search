# Word Search Solver

## Overview
The aim of this project is to help you practice designing code. 

When solving a word search you use a very simple algorithm for every word in the list, go through each letter and search every direction for the word. 

You will have to figure out how to iterate through a grid forward, backward, and diagonally. Then for each of those directions search for words. In an efficient and beautiful way.

## Setup

```
git clone
cd 
npm i -g live-server
live-server
```

Put your solution in `solution.js`, puzzles are located in `puzzle.js` both of these files are loaded and ran in `index.html`. Using `live-server` automatically reloads `index.html` every time you save a file in the directory
